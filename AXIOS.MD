# Axios Overview

Axios is a **JavaScript library** used to make **HTTP requests** to a server, such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.  
Instead of using the standard `fetch`, Axios makes interacting with servers **simpler and faster**.

## Key Features

- **Easy to use** – the code is simpler compared to `fetch`.
- **Automatic JSON support** – it can send and receive data in JSON format without extra work.
- **Error handling** – Axios provides a clear way to handle errors using `try/catch` or `.catch`.
- **Promise-based** – works seamlessly with `async/await`.
- **Advanced configurations** – supports custom `Headers`, `Timeouts`, and `Interceptors` to modify requests or responses globally.
